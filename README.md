# Hangman Game

This is a simple hangman game implemented in C++. The game randomly selects a word from a list of 1378 (I will change that in the future, currently just messing around with C++) words and the player's job is to guess the word by entering a letter. The player has 10 tries to guess the word correctly. Guessing a wrong vowel (a, e, u, i, o) will not affect the number of tries the player has.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. The program will display a welcome message and explain the rules of the game.
3. Enter the number of rounds you want to play (between 1 and 10).
4. The game will start and you will be prompted to enter a letter.
5. Enter a letter and press enter.
6. If the letter is correct and part of the word, it will be revealed in the word.
7. If the letter is incorrect, you will lose a try. Guessing a wrong vowel will not affect the number of tries.
8. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of tries.
9. After each round, the program will display the word you had to guess, your guesses, and the number of wrong guesses.
10. Once all rounds are completed, the program will display a summary of your performance.
